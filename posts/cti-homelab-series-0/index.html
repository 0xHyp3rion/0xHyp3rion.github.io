      <h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to go out on a limb and state that Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is one of the hardest domains within Cybersecurity to get into, let alone understand. Heck, what even is CTI anyway? How does it tie into the rest of Cybersecurity? What does it take to become a CTI Analyst? How do I become one? This blog series is intended for those who have an interest in learning more about CTI or who would like some hands-on projects to sink their teeth into to develop their skillset.</p>
<p>I am by no means an expert. I have zero background in intelligence (prior to my current job as a CTI Analyst), have never served in the military, and just like most of us in the industry, occasionally suffer from imposter syndrome when I compare my lack of qualifications and experience with those who have metaphorical chests full of medals and decorations. What I possess is a keen interest and curiosity in trying to answer the question &ldquo;why?&rdquo; And regardless of qualifications, you can be a successful CTI analyst as long as you have at least a perpetual curiosity and are full of &ldquo;why&rdquo; based questions.</p>
<p>This blog series is going to be divided into several parts, each focusing on a specific domain within the threat intelligence life cycle (don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll go into more detail about what that is shortly). Within each domain I&rsquo;m going to walk you through how to implement concepts from it using little more than what you have at home and design, set up, and deploy a Cyber Threat Intelligence homelab. The projects can be done on a single machine with virtualization capabilities, however I&rsquo;ll be using my own dedicated server that I deployed from a repurposed old laptop that was collecting dust; so feel free to scale this however you&rsquo;d like.</p>
<p>Some of the more mundane elements that can be found in countless other tutorials are going to be left out (such as how to set up VirtualBox on your computer), so if you&rsquo;re a complete beginner to Cybersecurity, let alone IT in general, this may be a little bit of a challenge to sink your teeth into; but I don&rsquo;t want to discourage anyone.</p>
<p>One of the major characteristics of the CTI field that I&rsquo;ve found is that it involves a lot of theory, and translating that theory into real-world actionable information. This is perhaps the trickiest element to achieve, but I&rsquo;ll do my best. So with all of that said, let&rsquo;s begin!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-cti">What is CTI?</h2>
<p>I personally compare Cyber Threat Intelligence to the role of being a weather forecaster with cyber threats. Since there&rsquo;s no foolproof method of accurately predicting the future with a non-existent margin of error (at least not yet), we can only make assumptions of what <em>could</em> happen based off of what <em>has</em> happened, and adequately improving defenses to protect against relevant and actionable threats.</p>
<p>The key words in that statement are &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; and &ldquo;actionable.&rdquo; A CTI analyst&rsquo;s role is ultimately determining what threats are relevant and how to encourage teams to take action against those threats. The level of relevance depends on how fresh and accurate the intelligence is, and the actions taken depend on the analyst&rsquo;s ability to relay that information in a manner that is in itself reliable.</p>
<p>Back to the weather forecaster analogy, if a meteorologist in New York sees that it&rsquo;s raining in California and the storm is moving northeast, he can reason that it will rain in New York at some point. However, without taking in the other complex variables that come in to play with weather, if he presented that assumption to stakeholders in a panic, encouraging them to invest in umbrellas, he would be seen as an untrustworthy and unreliable meteorologist; because, realistically, a rain storm will break apart as it moves across the country, the rain from California likely won&rsquo;t make it to New York, and strategic decision-makers will wonder why they&rsquo;re paying this guy a salary in the first place when all he does is supply incorrect and inaccurate information.</p>
<p>We do the same thing quite often in Cybersecurity without realizing it. Analysts will ingest countless threat feeds from multiple sources, create SIEM detection rules for every TTP under the sun, and the next thing they know, they have an overwhelmed SOC team and an unreliable detection engine producing countless false-positive alerts that reduce the reliability and the credibility of the team, the technology, and the organization as a whole.</p>
<p>CTI is the art of processing data to be wholly relevant and actionable to decision-makers, defining the capability of the threat and intent behind the threat actor in such a manner that streamlines the decision-making process and leads to more robust and efficient risk mitigation.</p>
<p>The data that makes up intelligence is, well, almost everything. IP addresses, file hashes, threat actors, geopolitical affairs, human psychology, doors and locks, software vulnerabilities, chat logs, voice recordings, visual images, and beyond. So with all of the information out there, how do we know what we need to focus on? We have to start somewhere, and thankfully we have a model called the Intelligence Lifecycle that serves somewhat as a step-by-step guide from start to finish. Spoiler alert: The lifecycle never ends&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="the-intelligence-lifecycle">The Intelligence Lifecycle</h2>
<p>The Intelligence Lifecycle is a model that allows analysts to follow a specific sequence of steps that are iterated and repeated endlessly. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Planning, Objectives, and Direction
<ol>
<li>Determining what assets need to be protected and what kind of intelligence is needed to protect them.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Collection
<ol>
<li>Determining where the intelligence is going to come from, and how.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Processing
<ol>
<li>Determining what is relevant and actionable from the raw intelligence.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Analysis and Production
<ol>
<li>Framing the processed intelligence into a more digestible form tailored towards its specific use-case, outlined in Planning, Objectives, and Direction.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Dissemination
<ol>
<li>Distributing the final intelligence products to stakeholders and those with a &ldquo;need-to-know.&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Feedback
<ol>
<li>Collecting feedback on the final product and dissemination to ensure that it met the original requirements of the stakeholder.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, this is only intended to provide a brief overview of concepts so I won&rsquo;t be delving tirelessly into the theoretical aspect of everything out there. I encourage you to do your own research on a lot of the topics covered here that aren&rsquo;t expanded on, especially since research is&hellip;well&hellip;99% of a CTI Analyst&rsquo;s job. Statisticians can call me out on that one, but I digress.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-the-levels-of-cti">Understanding the Levels of CTI</h2>
<p>There are 3 levels of CTI (also known as levels of war) that also need to be touched on here because they&rsquo;ll be referenced incessantly throughout this writeup:</p>
<p><strong>Strategic</strong>
This is higher-level, big-picture information. As an analogy, think of playing a real-time strategy game like Age of Empires II (does this date me at all?) where it&rsquo;s you on one side of the map pitted against another player. Your strategic objective is the high-level objective, or point of the overall game: Destroy the other player&rsquo;s base, and keep the other player from destroying yours. In the Cybersecurity world, the strategic level relates to the threat landscape as a whole, identifying what threats are relevant to the organization, and preventing them from occurring within the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Operational</strong>
This is where things become more technical but are still a little broad. Think threat actor TTPs. In our game analogy, this would be the individual battles that occur around the map, how they occur, and what the outcomes result in. In the Cybersecurity world, it&rsquo;s understanding how individual threat actors operate, what tools they use and how they work, and how to defend against them. An example of an operational objective would be building a wall around a particular resource node to protect the workers harvesting said resources, or in the real world, modelling the TTPs of a particular relevant threat actor and designing alerting logic around those TTPs.</p>
<p><strong>Tactical</strong>
This is a very granular level involving intelligence that can&rsquo;t be used repeatedly. In the game, imagine this as being each particular unit that makes up the other player&rsquo;s army. Once they&rsquo;re dead, they&rsquo;re dead, and a new unit has to be produced to replace it, unless it survives the engagement and gets reused. In the Cybersecurity world these are objects such as IP addresses, domains, file hashes etc.; data that, once used or revealed, makes it difficult for a threat actor to re-use because defenses can be improved surrounding the granular objects.</p>
<h2 id="the-project">The Project</h2>
<p>As I stated earlier, this project is going to follow each step of the Intelligence Lifecycle from start to finish, with projects to engage in at home with nothing more than yourself, the objects and technology around you, and some imagination. We&rsquo;re essentially going to be roleplaying. Or you&rsquo;re going to essentially be roleplaying. With yourself. Kind of like you have multiple personalities.</p>
<p>I want you to imagine yourself as 3 different people: CEO, Security Manager, and CTI Analyst.</p>
<p>For your CEO hat, imagine yourself as the CEO of the environment around you. You want to make sure everything around you is doing as it&rsquo;s supposed to. You don&rsquo;t care about the technical details, you just care that what needs to continue happening continues happening so that your environment can succeed and thrive. You&rsquo;re responsible for signing off and approving any changes that need to be made within the environment.</p>
<p>For your Security Manager hat, imagine yourself as being concerned about the security of everything around you. You want to make sure that nobody except those that you give permission can access your environment, both physically and digitally. You&rsquo;re responsible for tracking and managing assets that are responsible for security, and bringing up any changes and resource requests to the CEO.</p>
<p>For your CTI Analyst hat, imagine yourself as being fresh to the job as a CTI Analyst where the security team is looking to implement a CTI program. You&rsquo;re going to be responsible for identifying, tracking, and reporting on threats, and convincing the Security Manager and CEO to care about these threats and take action.</p>
<p>Does this already sound stupid? Probably, but the intent is to emulate the real world, and I&rsquo;ll do my very best to justify every exercise with real-world analogies and comparisons. If you&rsquo;d rather just follow along, you can ignore the &ldquo;Scenario&rdquo; section of each module.</p>
<h2 id="practice-exercise-optional">Practice Exercise (Optional)</h2>
<p>For the first exercise in our project, brainstorm a fake company name to call yourself. I&rsquo;ll be using mine throughout the rest of the project, Cyber Boulder Roller Corporation, or CBR Corp.</p>
