      <description>Prologue I&amp;rsquo;m going to go out on a limb and state that Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is one of the hardest domains within Cybersecurity to get into, let alone understand. Heck, what even is CTI anyway? How does it tie into the rest of Cybersecurity? What does it take to become a CTI Analyst? How do I become one? This blog series is intended for those who have an interest in learning more about CTI or who would like some hands-on projects to sink their teeth into to develop their skillset.</description>

      <description>Oh, so you&amp;rsquo;ve ventured over here to know a little more about me?
I&amp;rsquo;m nobody special. Another anonymous voice on the internet. One thing I can proudly say is that I&amp;rsquo;m 100% organic. No AI generated content goes here.
To humor you for clicking this page, I&amp;rsquo;m a self-taught Cybersecurity professional currently working as a CTI Analyst.
My hobbies include reading copius amounts of dry literature on philosophy, human psychology, cybersecurity, geopolitical affairs, and economics.</description>
